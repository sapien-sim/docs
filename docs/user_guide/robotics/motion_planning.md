# Motion Planning

We recommend the `mplib` library for motion planning with SAPIEN. `mplib` is a
lightweight python package that includes common functionalities for motion
planning. You can use mplib to plan a collision-free trajectory for a robot,
calculate inverse kinematics, and take point cloud observation as an environment
model. Unlike MoveIt, mplib is decoupled from ROS, and itâ€™s easy to set up and
use with simple python APIs.

The tutorial for mplib can be found in their official [documentation site](https://motion-planning-lib.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/getting_started.html).
